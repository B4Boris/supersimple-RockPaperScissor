# supersimple-Rock Paper Scissors â€” Learning Project

## Overview
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built as a hands-on exercise to learn and practice the basics of web development. The main goal is to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive web pages.

## Learning Focus

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page. Notice how buttons, headings, and results are organized in different containers.
- **CSS**: Handles the visual styling. Pay attention to how flexbox is used for layout, how buttons are styled to look interactive, and how classes are used to target elements.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity. See how button clicks trigger functions that update the result and chosen emojis on the page.

**Key Concepts:**
- How to connect HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- Using event handlers (like `onclick`) to trigger JavaScript functions.
- Dynamically updating the DOM with JavaScript.
- Organizing code for readability and maintainability.

## How Things Are Related

- The HTML file (`index.html`) lays out the structure and references the CSS and JS files.
- The CSS file (`styles.css`) styles the layout, buttons, and results for a modern look.
- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the game logic and updates the page in response to user actions.
